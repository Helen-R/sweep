> Extending `broom` to time series forecasting

The `sweep` package extends the `broom` tools (tidy, glance, and augment) for performing forecasts and time series analysis in the "tidyverse". The package is geared towards the workflow required to perform forecasts using Rob Hyndman's `forecast` package, and it contains elements that can help when performing time series analysis using tibbles ("tidy" data frames). 

## Benefits

* __Designed for modeling and scaling forecasts using the the `tidyverse` tools in [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)__
* __Extends `broom` for model analysis (ARIMA, ETS, BATS, etc)__
* __Tidies the `forecast()` output for easy plotting and "tidy" data manipulation__
* __Integrates `timekit` to enable working with dates and datetimes (irregular time series) as well as numeric time series (regular time series)__


## Tools

The package contains the following elements:

1. __model tidiers__: `sw_tidy`, `sw_glance`, `sw_augment`, `sw_tidy_decomp` functions extend `tidy`, `glance`, and `augment` from the `broom` package specifically for models (`ets()`, `Arima()`, `bats()`, etc) used for forecasting. 

2. __forecast tidier__: `sw_sweep` converts a `forecast` object to a tibble that can be easily manipulated in the "tidyverse".


## Making forecasts in the tidyverse

`sweep` enables transitioning from tibble to ts, from ts to model (e.g. Arima, ets, etc), from model to forecast, and then from forecast to tibble. The result is ability to use `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot` natively to manipulate, analyze and visualize forecasts.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/forecast.png")
```

## Forecasting multiple time series groups at scale

Often forecasts are required on grouped data to analyse trends in sub-categories. The good news is scaling from one time series to many is easy with the various `sw_` functions in combination with `dplyr` and `purrr`.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/time_series_groups.png")
```

## Forecasting multiple models for accuracy

A common goal in forecasting is to compare different forecast models against each other. `sweep` helps in this area as well.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/multiple_models.png")
```

## broom extensions for forecasting

If you are familiar with `broom`, you know how useful it is for retrieving "tidy" format model coefficients (`tidy`), accuracy statistics (`glance`), and residuals (`augment`). The `sweep` package extends these functions to forecast modeling functions such as ARIMA, ETS, BATS, TBATS, NNETAR, and more: just use the `sweep` functions, `sw_tidy`, `sw_glance`, and `sw_augment`. In addition, new tidiers, `sw_tidy_decomp` is designed to specifically tidy models that produce seasonal decompositions and `sw_sweep` is designed to tidy forecast prediction outputs. The compatibility chart is listed below.

```{r, echo = F}
tibble::tribble(
    ~Function,       ~`sw_tidy()`, ~`sw_glance()`, ~`sw_augment()`, ~`sw_tidy_decomp()`, ~`sw_sweep()`,
    "ar()",          "",  "",  "", "",   "",
